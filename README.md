# SeC - Sentieri e Cartografia UI
SeC UI helps working with the [SeC API](https://github.com/loreV/SeC).  
It supports manipulation and visualization of trails related data.
## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project.  
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.  
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
### Development Run
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
## Vision and challenges
SeC UI aims to be a strong end-user focused UI, that easily allow to gather and save rich data about trails, while connecting this data to a community accessibility notifications, planned maintenance data and POI.
It aims to provide a first point of access for trails management while integrating to central storage via OSM by REST APIs.
